    <h1>Types of Narrative Text</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      A narrative is a story, and stories can be categorized into several main types based on their content and purpose. 
      Here are some of the most common examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Fables</strong><br>
        These are short stories where the main characters are usually animals that talk and act like humans. Their purpose is to teach a moral lesson. 
        <span class="example">Example: The Tortoise and the Hare, which teaches that consistency is more important than speed.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>2. Fairy Tales</strong><br>
        Fairy tales are stories that often involve magic, mythical creatures (like fairies, dragons, or giants), and a fantasy world. They often have a happy ending. 
        <span class="example">Example: Cinderella, Snow White.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>3. Legends</strong><br>
        A legend is a folk tale that is believed to have a historical basis and often explains the origin of a place, a natural phenomenon, or an object.
        <span class="example">Example: The Legend of King Arthur.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>4. Myths</strong><br>
        Myths are ancient stories that aim to explain the origin of the universe, gods and goddesses, or natural events. They are considered sacred by a particular culture.
        <span class="example">Example: Greek Myths of Zeus and Olympus.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>5. Folktales</strong><br>
        These are stories passed down orally from generation to generation, reflecting the values and traditions of a culture. They can be humorous, adventurous, or even scary. 
        <span class="example">Example: Bawang Merah & Bawang Putih, The Boy Who Cried Wolf.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>6. Horror Stories</strong><br>
        A narrative created to evoke feelings of fear, suspense, and dread in the reader. These stories often involve ghosts, monsters, or psychological threats.
        <span class="example">Example: Dracula, urban legends.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>7. Fantasy</strong><br>
        A fictional story set in a non-real world that often involves magic, magical creatures (elves, orcs), and a battle between good and evil. 
        <span class="example">Example: Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>8. Sci-Fi (Science Fiction)</strong><br>
        This genre uses speculative science and technology as the main elements of the story. These narratives often explore the future, robots, space travel, or the effects of technology on humanity.
        <span class="example">Example: Star Wars, The Matrix.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>9. Mystery</strong><br>
        A story centered on solving a puzzle, a crime, or a strange event. The hero of the story is often a detective who looks for clues to uncover the truth.
        <span class="example">Example: Sherlock Holmes.</span>
      </li>

      <li><strong>10. Life Stories (Biography/Autobiography)</strong><br>
        These are non-fiction narratives about a person's life. A biography is written by someone else, while an autobiography is written by the person themselves. 
        <span class="example">Example: Nelson Mandela’s biography.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>

          <!-- Introduction -->
          <article id="intro">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p>Science fiction (Sci-Fi) is more than a genre of literature and cinema—it is a cultural force that bridges imagination and scientific inquiry. It functions simultaneously as entertainment, speculation, philosophical reflection, and social critique. Through futuristic settings, imagined technologies, and speculative scenarios, sci-fi allows us to ask “what if?” in ways that conventional narratives cannot.</p>
              <p>The significance of science fiction lies not only in its entertainment value but also in its pedagogical, philosophical, and political dimensions. By projecting current scientific knowledge into hypothetical futures, sci-fi provides a laboratory for thought experiments. It allows audiences to anticipate potential consequences of technology, ethical dilemmas of artificial intelligence, and environmental crises of tomorrow. Thus, it operates as a cultural mirror and a warning system.</p>
              <p>In academic settings, sci-fi can enhance scientific literacy, encourage critical thinking, and promote interdisciplinary discussion. Its combination of storytelling and science allows teachers to integrate language, social studies, and STEM in one compelling package.</p>

          </article>

          <!-- Definition -->
          <article id="definition">
            <h2>2. Definition</h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p><strong>Science fiction</strong> can be defined as a branch of speculative fiction that systematically explores imagined futures, advanced technologies, and alternative realities grounded in scientific principles or logical speculation. Unlike fantasy, which relies on magical systems, sci-fi is constrained by the logic of science, even if it extends or extrapolates from it.</p>
              <p>According to scholars, sci-fi is both a literary genre and a “mode of thought.” It is not limited to books or films—it encompasses comics, television, video games, and even virtual simulations. Its key function is to test the limits of human imagination and responsibility within contexts that challenge conventional reality.</p>
              <p>Whereas fantasy asks, “what if magic were real?”, sci-fi asks, “what if science took us further than we imagined?”</p>

          <!-- Characteristics -->
          <article id="characteristics">
            <h2>3. Characteristics of Science Fiction</h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p>Science fiction as a genre is diverse, yet it is unified by several recurring characteristics. Below are ten detailed features that frequently define sci-fi narratives:</p>

              <h3>1) Scientific Grounding</h3>
              <p>Every work of science fiction is anchored, at least loosely, in scientific reasoning. Even if the science is speculative or hypothetical, there must be an internal logic that makes the world believable. Concepts from physics (relativity, time dilation), biology (genetic engineering), or computer science (AI, cyberspace) are common. The more consistent the scientific grounding, the easier it is for readers to suspend disbelief.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: <em>Interstellar</em> integrates Einstein’s relativity into its narrative; <em>Jurassic Park</em> uses cloning and DNA manipulation as its premise.</div>

              <h3>2) Speculation and the "What If" Question</h3>
              <p>Sci-fi thrives on speculative questions: “What if humans colonized Mars?”; “What if machines developed consciousness?” Such hypotheticals allow narratives to test moral, political, and existential boundaries. These “what if” scenarios are not merely imaginative—they are ethical laboratories.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: <em>Blade Runner</em> explores artificial consciousness; <em>The Matrix</em> questions the reality of human perception.</div>

              <h3>3) Futuristic or Alternative Settings</h3>
              <p>From distant galaxies to post-apocalyptic Earths, the settings of sci-fi expand beyond the present. These settings are not just backdrops but essential frameworks for exploring human dilemmas under extraordinary conditions. The accuracy and richness of these environments are critical to immersion.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: Mars colonies in <em>The Martian</em>, post-nuclear wastelands in <em>Mad Max</em>, or digital spaces in <em>Ready Player One</em>.</div>

              <h3>4) World-Building</h3>
              <p>Detailed construction of culture, politics, technology, and environment distinguishes sci-fi from simpler speculative tales. Authors design entire ecosystems, power hierarchies, economies, and even new languages to make the story world coherent and compelling.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: <em>Dune</em> presents a desert planet with complex ecology, feudal politics, and economic struggle over spice.</div>

              <h3>5) Complex Characters and Moral Dilemmas</h3>
              <p>Characters in sci-fi are rarely flat. Scientists, explorers, rebels, or artificial beings face dilemmas about morality, survival, and identity. Questions of responsibility, ethical boundaries, and the meaning of humanity often take center stage.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: Victor Frankenstein’s responsibility to his creation; Ava in <em>Ex Machina</em> demanding recognition as a sentient being.</div>

              <h3>6) Ideological and Existential Conflict</h3>
              <p>Beyond physical battles, sci-fi often dramatizes struggles of ideas: freedom versus control, reality versus illusion, humanity versus machine. These conflicts invite reflection on the philosophical essence of human life.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: <em>1984</em> critiques authoritarian control; <em>The Matrix</em> examines comfort versus truth.</div>

              <h3>7) Social Critique</h3>
              <p>Science fiction frequently critiques contemporary society under the veil of futurism. Issues such as surveillance, inequality, colonialism, and ecological exploitation are projected into future worlds, forcing readers to reconsider present realities.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: <em>Avatar</em> as a metaphor for colonial exploitation; <em>Black Mirror</em> exposes the dark consequences of digital culture.</div>

              <h3>8) Duality of Optimism and Warning</h3>
              <p>Sci-fi can be utopian or dystopian—or both. While some works celebrate human progress and technological potential, others issue stark warnings about unregulated science. This duality makes sci-fi a genre of balance, oscillating between hope and caution.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: <em>Star Trek</em> embodies optimism; <em>Terminator</em> warns against uncontrolled AI.</div>

              <h3>9) Scientific Jargon and Neologisms</h3>
              <p>Sci-fi often invents terms or borrows technical jargon to make its world credible. Neologisms (new words) are essential tools of world-building, signaling unfamiliarity while anchoring narratives in plausibility.</p>
              <div class="example">Examples: wormhole, singularity, hyperspace, neural-link, lightsaber.</div>

              <h3>10) Universal Human Concerns</h3>
              <p>Beneath its futuristic settings, sci-fi grapples with universal human issues: love, loss, freedom, fear, and the search for meaning. Technology is merely the medium—humanity remains the subject.</p>
              <div class="example">Example: <em>Her</em> explores loneliness and intimacy; <em>Interstellar</em> emphasizes love as a force shaping survival.</div>
            </div>

            <h2>4. Historical Development</h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p>The history of sci-fi can be traced from mythological imagination to modern speculative science. Early myths of flight and cosmic travel foreshadowed the genre. During the Renaissance, scientific exploration fueled proto-science fiction tales. The modern genre began with Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> (1818), which combined scientific experimentation with ethical inquiry.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>19th Century:</strong> Jules Verne and H.G. Wells explored submarines, time travel, and alien invasions.</li>
                <li><strong>Golden Age (1920s–1950s):</strong> Pulp magazines popularized space adventures and robots. Writers like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke defined “hard sci-fi.”</li>
                <li><strong>New Wave (1960s–1970s):</strong> Authors such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Philip K. Dick emphasized psychology, philosophy, and experimental narratives.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyberpunk (1980s–1990s):</strong> William Gibson and others highlighted digital technology, cyberspace, and corporate dystopias.</li>
                <li><strong>Contemporary Sci-Fi (2000s–present):</strong> Diverse voices focus on global issues: climate change, AI ethics, and identity politics.</li>
              </ul>

          <!-- Themes -->
          <article id="themes">
            <h2>5. Common Themes</h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p>Science fiction continually revisits certain themes that remain relevant to human civilization:</p>
              <h3>Technology and Ethics</h3>
              <p>How far should science go? Who is accountable when technology escapes control? These questions recur in stories about AI, cloning, and biotechnology.</p>
              <h3>Environmental Crisis</h3>
              <p>Sci-fi often imagines ecological collapse as a reflection of today’s environmental anxieties. It warns of over-exploitation while imagining possible solutions.</p>
              <h3>Identity and Consciousness</h3>
              <p>What defines humanity? Cyborgs, AI, and genetic modifications force re-examination of human identity and consciousness.</p>
              <h3>Politics and Power</h3>
              <p>From dystopian surveillance states to galactic empires, sci-fi scrutinizes how power is structured and abused.</p>
              <h3>Exploration and Colonization</h3>
              <p>The dream of space exploration often intersects with questions of colonialism, ethics, and cultural contact with alien species.</p>

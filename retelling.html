    <h2>What is Retelling?</h2>
    <p>
      Retelling is the ability to recount a story or text using your own words while keeping the main ideas, sequence, and important details. 
      This practice is essential in speaking because it improves comprehension, vocabulary use, fluency, and confidence. 
      In this module, we will focus on retelling <strong>science fiction (sci-fi)</strong> stories.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Steps in Retelling a Story</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Read or Listen</strong> to the story carefully. Pay attention to the beginning, middle, and ending.</li>
      <li><strong>Identify the Main Characters</strong> (heroes, villains, or creatures in sci-fi).</li>
      <li><strong>Note the Setting</strong> (place and time â€“ e.g., another planet, the future, or a spaceship).</li>
      <li><strong>Find the Problem</strong> or conflict faced by the characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Observe the Solution</strong> or how the characters overcome the problem.</li>
      <li><strong>Retell the Story</strong> in your own words. Do not memorize; instead, reconstruct the story logically.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Example: Short Sci-Fi Story</h2>
    <div class="example">
      <p><em>Original text:</em></p>
      <p>
        "In the year 2145, Earth was no longer safe. Humanity built giant ships to travel across galaxies. 
        One young pilot, Aira, discovered a hidden planet with strange glowing forests. 
        But the planet was guarded by machines that tested her bravery. 
        In the end, Aira proved her courage, and the machines welcomed humans to settle there."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <p><em>Retelling in simple words:</em></p>
      <p>
        "The story is about the future when Earth was unsafe. People traveled to other galaxies. 
        A young pilot named Aira found a planet with glowing forests. 
        The planet had machines that tested her, but she showed bravery and gained permission for humans to live there."

  <section>
    <h2>Practice Activity</h2>
    <p>Now try to retell the story step by step:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who is the main character?</li>
      <li>Where and when does the story happen?</li>
      <li>What problem does the character face?</li>
      <li>How is the problem solved?</li>
      <li>Retell the story in your own words (2-3 sentences, then expand to 5-6 sentences).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tips for Good Retelling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use your <strong>own words</strong>, do not memorize exactly.</li>
      <li>Speak with <strong>clear pronunciation</strong> and proper pauses.</li>
      <li>Include <strong>connectors</strong> like <em>first, then, after that, finally</em>.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>intonation</strong> to show emotions (fear, excitement, courage).</li>
      <li>Practice with both <strong>short retelling</strong> (summary) and <strong>long retelling</strong> (detailed version).</li>
    </ul>

        "Lena lived on a space station orbiting Mars. She felt lonely until she built a small robot named Zino. 
        One day, the station lost power, and Zino risked itself to restore the energy. 
        Thanks to the robot, Lena and the crew survived."

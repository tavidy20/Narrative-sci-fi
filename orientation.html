    <h1>Orientation</h1>
    <p>
      In a narrative text, the <strong>Orientation</strong> is the very first stage of the story. 
      Its function is to introduce the audience to the world of the story by giving them 
      enough background information to understand what is happening. Without Orientation, 
      readers or viewers may feel lost because they do not know who the characters are, 
      where the story is set, or when the events are taking place. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Orientation usually covers three important elements:
    </p>

    <h2>Key Elements:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Who:</strong> The introduction of the main characters. This may include the protagonist (main hero), the antagonist (enemy or conflict creator), and supporting characters. A clear introduction helps the audience build a connection with the characters.</li>
      <li><strong>Where:</strong> The setting of the story. Is it in a real place, such as a city, a forest, or outer space? Or is it in an imaginary or fantasy world?</li>
      <li><strong>When:</strong> The time when the story happens. Is it in the past, present, future, or in a timeless, magical period?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples from Popular Movies:</h2>

    <div class="example">
      üîπ <strong>Interstellar (2014):</strong><br>
      At the beginning of the film, we are introduced to a near-future Earth that is suffering from dust storms and food shortages. 
      We meet Cooper, a former NASA pilot who now works as a farmer, living with his daughter Murphy and his family. 
      This Orientation gives us the background: <em>Who</em> (Cooper and his family), <em>Where</em> (a struggling Earth), 
      and <em>When</em> (the near future during a global ecological crisis).
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      üîπ <strong>Star Wars: A New Hope (1977):</strong><br>
      The movie opens with the iconic text crawl that tells us about a galaxy far, far away 
      that is in the middle of a civil war. Then, we see Princess Leia‚Äôs ship being chased by the Empire‚Äôs Star Destroyer. 
      Soon after, we meet Luke Skywalker, a young man living on the desert planet Tatooine. 
      This Orientation introduces the audience to the galactic conflict (<em>When</em> & <em>Where</em>), 
      and the central characters like Leia, Luke, and the Empire (<em>Who</em>).
    </div>

    <p class="note">
      üëâ In short, the Orientation sets the stage and prepares the reader or viewer before the main conflict begins.

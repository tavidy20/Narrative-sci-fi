    <h1>Complication</h1>
    <p>
      In a narrative text, the <strong>Complication</strong> is the core part of the story where the conflict begins to appear and develop. 
      Without complication, a story would be flat and uninteresting because there would be no problems to solve. 
      Complication introduces challenges, struggles, and obstacles that the characters must face. 
      It is the part that makes readers or viewers curious about how the story will continue. 
    </p>

    <h2>Sources of Conflict:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Man vs. Man:</strong> Conflict between two characters, such as a hero against a villain or two friends in disagreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Man vs. Nature:</strong> Conflict between a character and natural forces like storms, disasters, or harsh environments.</li>
      <li><strong>Man vs. Himself:</strong> Internal conflict within the character, such as fear, doubt, guilt, or difficult decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Man vs. Society:</strong> Conflict between the character and societal rules, norms, or traditions that limit their freedom.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Climax</h2>
    <p>
      The complication usually builds up towards the <strong>Climax</strong>, which is the highest point of tension in the story. 
      At this stage, the character must face the problem directly, and the outcome will determine how the story proceeds. 
    </p>

    <h2>Examples from Popular Movies:</h2>

    <div class="example">
      üîπ <strong>Interstellar (2014):</strong><br>
      After Cooper joins the NASA mission, the complication arises when he and his crew face unexpected dangers in space, 
      such as massive waves on the water planet and the betrayal of Dr. Mann. At the same time, Cooper struggles internally 
      with guilt for leaving his daughter behind. These conflicts (man vs. nature, man vs. man, and man vs. himself) 
      drive the story forward and create high tension.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      üîπ <strong>Star Wars: A New Hope (1977):</strong><br>
      The complication begins when Luke discovers Princess Leia‚Äôs message hidden in R2-D2, leading him into the galactic conflict. 
      Soon, Luke faces the cruelty of the Empire, the death of his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the responsibility of joining the Rebellion. 
      The climax builds when Luke must destroy the Death Star, facing danger head-on and proving his growth as a hero.
    </div>

    <p class="note">
      üëâ Complication serves as the driving force of the story, keeping the audience engaged and eager to know the resolution.

    <h2>What is Narrative Text?</h2>
    <p>Narrative text is a type of text used to tell a story that can be based on real experiences or imagination. Its main purpose is to entertain readers while conveying the message, knowledge, or moral values contained in the story. Narrative texts come in many forms, ranging from fairy tales, legends, fables, myths, novels, films, historical stories, to works of science fiction (Sci-Fi). Although they differ in form, they all share the same characteristic, which is to present a series of interconnected events that form a complete story.
    </p>
    <p>The distinctive feature of narrative text lies in the characters who experience certain events. Stories are usually told chronologically or logically, so that readers can follow the story from beginning to end. In many cases, the story also features conflicts or challenges experienced by the characters, thereby appealing to and engaging the reader's emotions.
    </p>
    <p>The function of narrative text is not limited to entertainment, but also has educational value. Fables, for example, convey moral lessons through the behavior of animals that are treated like humans, while legends preserve the identity and cultural heritage of a region. Similarly, the Sci-Fi genre, although imaginative, often opens readers' minds to the possibilities of scientific and technological developments, as well as presenting social reflections on the future of humanity. In this way, narrative text not only enriches the imagination, but also instills valuable life values and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of language, narrative texts generally use the past tense, action verbs, and vivid descriptions to strengthen the reader's imagination. The language used not only conveys events but also builds atmosphere, emotion, and imagery that make readers feel as if they are part of the story.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, narrative text can be seen as a form of text that has a multidimensional role. It entertains, educates, preserves culture, broadens horizons on science and technology through modern genres such as Sci-Fi, and enriches the reader's imaginative experience. Therefore, narrative text plays an important role in language and cultural learning, because in addition to training language skills, it also helps students understand life values in various contexts.</p>
